    "\n",
    "On April 15, 1912, the largest passenger liner ever made collided with an iceberg during her maiden voyage. When the Titanic sank it killed 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck resulted in such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n",

    "The `titanic_data.csv` file contains data for `887` of the real Titanic passengers. Each row represents one person. The columns describe different attributes about the person including whether they survived (`0=No`), their age, their passenger-class (`1=1st Class, Upper`), gender, and the fare they paid (Â£s*).

    "The Logistic regression had the highest f1 score ( the harmoic mean of recall and persion). They all had an accuracy around 70%, but the kNN was about 68%. The SVM had an accuracy value of 76% and the Logistic regreesion was 80%. The cross validation scores for the svm were lower than the compared models. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most true positives, 123 tp, came from the cross validation report. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What feaures and parameters were used to achieve that performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the KNN i ustilize a k of 6. For the SVM i ustilized the RBF kernel and a C value of 50. I changed the CV in my cross validation parameter to 5 and then to 15 but it didn't seem to affect the classification report metrics. I set it to seven becuse I didn't want the future warning box to show up anymore. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What insights did you gain from your experimentation about the predictive power of this dataset and did it match your original hypothesis about the relationship between given feature data and the target?\n",
    "\n",
    "when working with alot of features the best model to use it a logsitc regression. KNN is good for small sets of data. SVM and Logistic regression had simmular classification report metrics, but the cross validation report in SVM was smaller for all the features. \n"
